# Murf Voice Agent

Welcome to **Murf Voice Agent**!  
This project is designed to empower developers and businesses to build intelligent, responsive, and natural-sounding voice agent solutions. Whether you’re looking to integrate conversational AI into your apps, automate customer support, or prototype voice-driven workflows, Murf Voice Agent provides a flexible foundation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Natural Language Understanding:** Quickly process and interpret user speech input using state-of-the-art NLP models.
- **Speech Synthesis:** Generate clear, human-like responses using advanced TTS (Text-To-Speech) engines.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple APIs to plug into existing platforms, chatbots, or voice assistants.
- **Customizable Workflows:** Configure conversational flows and responses to suit a wide range of use cases.
- **Extensible:** Add plugins or connect to external services for enhanced capabilities (e.g., translation, sentiment analysis).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** Provides user interaction via voice or text, capturing audio and displaying responses.
- **Backend:** Handles speech-to-text conversion, intent recognition, and response generation.
- **APIs:** Exposes endpoints for integration with third-party applications or services.
