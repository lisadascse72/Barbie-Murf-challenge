## üöÄ Project Overview

**Murf-AI 30 Days** is a hands-on exploration of AI-powered voice agents.  
The objectives include:
- Creating intelligent voice bots
- Integrating with APIs
- Experimenting with speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- Building scalable microservices for conversational AI

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** (Core scripts & backend API)
- **Flask / FastAPI** (API server)
- **SpeechRecognition** (Speech-to-text)
- **gTTS** / **pyttsx3** (Text-to-speech)
- **OpenAI API** (Language model integration)
- **Docker** (Containerization)
- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD)

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lisadascse72/Murf-AI-30-days.git
cd Murf-AI-30-days
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
# Add other keys as needed for TTS/STT providers
```

### 4. Run the API server
```bash
# For Flask
python app.py

# For FastAPI
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 5. Test the Voice Agent
Use `curl`, Postman, or the provided web UI to interact with your agent.
